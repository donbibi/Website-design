<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of <code>age</code> distributions within populations is a cornerstone in demographic studies, enabling researchers to understand variations and underlying trends that might affect both social policies and economic frameworks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Normal</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution">t-distributions</a> are commonly used in statistics to model real-world data, where the former often underpins assumed symmetry in biological data, and the latter accommodates outliers by being more robust due to its heavier tails. This study aims to compare these two statistical models by applying them to simulated data representing ages in two distinct sample populations. Understanding the differences in these distributions can help in making more informed decisions when choosing statistical models for demographic analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>The study utilized <a href="https://www.stata.com/stata15/">Stata 15</a> software to simulate two separate datasets representing age distributions for two sample populations. The simulation was performed as follows: The Stata environment was cleared of previous data and settings, and a seed for random number generation was set to <code>340600</code> to ensure reproducibility of the results. A dataset of <code>30</code> observations was generated to represent the age of individuals from a population modeled by a <u>normal distribution</u>. The age variable <code>age</code> was created by adjusting a normally distributed random variable (<code>mean</code> = 57, <code>standard deviation</code> = 15). Concurrently, another age dataset for a different population was simulated using a <u>t-distribution</u> <code>age_t</code>, intended to capture a broader age range (<code>mean</code> = 17, <code>scale</code> = 15). For both datasets, histograms were plotted to visualize the distribution of age. The <code>histograms</code> were color-coded for distinction, <span style="color:orange;">orange</span> for the <i>normal distribution</i> and <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> for the <i>t-distribution</i>. Additionally, a theoretical normal curve was superimposed on the <code>histograms</code> to serve as a reference.The graphical output was configured to display the <code>histograms</code> side-by-side with associated legends and a title, Age distribution in two sample populations. This allowed direct visual comparison of the empirical data with the theoretical model. A footnote indicating the simulated nature of the data was also included in the graph.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The <code>histogram</code> of distribution of $\text{Age, years} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu=57,,\sigma^{2}=225$ revealed distinct differences between the two simulated distribution. The <code>normal distribution</code> appeared symmetric around the <code>mean age</code> of <code>57 years</code>, closely aligning with the theoretical normal curve superimposed on the graph. In contrast, the <code>t-distribution</code>, represented by the sample starting at a <code>mean age</code> of <code>17 years</code>, showed a wider spread and heavier tails, indicating more variability and a potential presence of outliers.</p>
